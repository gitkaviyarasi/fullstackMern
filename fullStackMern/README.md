I was struck with the module 1 as I was thinking too much and was not able to be sure to do one thing, and I started late and halfway through I did not feel like I was doing my best, so Skipped to module 2. I was also watching the react course from youtube which touched up the reuirement for module 2, so did the module 2 easliy and started with module 3 soon, since for that I able to choose what i was going to do. I went through the videos and it was a good refresher so was able to complete 3 with confidence. Then for module 4 again I was able to finish up soon I went through code in from the class and was able to complete the module.

For the module 5 I was looking for API was not able to find a good one, and then settled with the google book API, and was able to finish the back end code and tested the API in insomnia.For the front end I washaving difficulty becase it is almost time for the submission and I was not able to finish the front end code. I just have the sigup,login and the home page, was planning to add review and save a list for books for user, delete a book and the css fully done. 
Some of the challenges I faced were:
1. I kept missing the gitignore file and had to delte them in the git hub.
2. Setting up the correct folder structure was a bit difficult.
3. I was facing an issue with testing the login endpoint, since the password was not encrypted before saving as await was missed in the code. I learned that I need to be careful with the async and await in the code.
4. Had some difficulty while testing the APIs as I totally forgot to add token in insomnia.
5. I was not able to find a good API for the book search, so I settled with the google book API.
