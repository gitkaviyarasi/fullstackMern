Challenges faced:  
1. node module was added to git hub since git ignore was only present in the client. 
2. seting up the correct folder structure.
3. was facing a issue will testing the login endpoint, since the password was not encrypted before saving as await was missed in the code.




        
        1. add regex for email and password.
        2. delete is not done.
